<p>Cole is best used when it is with multiple people who are responsible for your website.</p>

<p>Cole features a comprehensive user account system that allows each user to have their own login details, settings and permissions.</p>

<p>It allows administrators to take control of the system and design an experience for copy writers or marketing teams etc to see and control only what is nessecary.</p>

<p>Cole can also be instructed to lock user permissions using the database, although it is advised that your Cole administrator applies this setting.</p>

<h1>Setting up a new user account</h1>
<p>It is very easy to setup a user account for use with Cole. In this section we will walk you through how to create an account, set a password and apply permissions to the account.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click your profile picture on the <strong>Cole Sidebar</strong></li>

    <li>Click <i class="zmdi zmdi-file-plus"></i> Create</li>
    <li>Enter the full name of the person whom you are attributing the user account to.</li>
    <li>Provide their email address. This will be used for notifications and other Cole features such as authentication.</li>
    <li>Type a password for the user. It's best to create a strong, unique password that isn't easily guessed and isn't shared with anyone else</li>
    <li>Choose whether or not this user should use Night mode. Night mode colours parts of the interface in a darker colour pallete which is best for using Cole at night.</li>

    <li>Click <i class="zmdi zmdi-check"></i> Save changes</li>
