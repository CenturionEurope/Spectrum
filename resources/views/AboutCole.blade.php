		<p>Cole is a CMS Developed by Peter Day that allows quick and pain free management of your website.</p>
		<p>Cole is different from most CMS systems in the sense that it automatically builds itself, detects when things goes wrong and updates itself to be quicker and more efficient then ever before</p>
		<p>Cole at its core is Non site dependant. That means that the modules that Cole creates for itself have not been engineered explicitly for one module and its purposes, moreover Cole has a system that builds interfaces that are needed as they are needed.</p>
		
		<p>Because of this, if you had a new feature on your website, Cole can plug into it designing a user interface in most cases with just one Database entry.</p>
		
		<p>This automatic behaviour and self creating aspect means that Cole is everything you need in a CMS system and adapts as your site does.</p>
